# 🕵️ LinkedIn Profile Scraper (People + Companies)

This repository contains two Python scripts that **scrape LinkedIn profile and company information** using `Selenium` and `undetected-chromedriver` — a stealth solution that avoids bot detection and bypasses LinkedIn's scraping restrictions.

It simulates **human-like behavior**, manages cookies to stay logged in, and ensures **LinkedIn does not detect or block your actions** during scraping.

## 📦 Features

- ✅ Uses `undetected-chromedriver` to bypass LinkedIn bot detection
- ✅ Simulates human scrolling and random delays
- ✅ Waits for full internet connection before actions
- ✅ Reuses login session via `cookies.pkl`
- ✅ Skips already-processed profiles/companies
- ✅ Automatically resumes after interruptions
- ✅ Modular: Profile scraping and Company scraping are separated

  - Name
  - Headline
